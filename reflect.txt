What I like about Python :

Readability: Python is incredibly readable and simple to comprehend thanks to its simple syntax and clear design. This feature improves teamwork and code comprehension.
Python's expressivity and clarity of expression let you do a lot with little code. It is simple to develop effective and beautiful solutions because to its built-in data structures and high-level abstractions.
Comprehensive standard library: The standard library in Python provides a large selection of modules and functions that are ready-to-use solutions for a variety of tasks, which can reduce the amount of time needed for development.
Python is simple and has a clear syntax, making it user-friendly for beginners. It enables programmers to concentrate more on solving problems rather than getting bogged down in intricate linguistic details.

What I dislike about Python:

Python has performance issues since it is an interpreted language, which means that it executes programmes more slowly than compiled languages like C and C++. When performance is important, this may be cause for concern.
(GIL) Global Interpreter Lock Python's inability to fully utilise multiple CPU cores is restricted by the GIL, which could negatively affect the performance of multi-threaded applications.
